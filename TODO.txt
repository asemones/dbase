implement the io-uring write engine
implement scheduling with coroutines
//complete both by march 31st, fully tested
//do these first
//maybe dont integrate 

txn stuff:
proper read/write for txns, consistent etc
properly check l_0 and l_1->l_7 for the correct keys + filter based on the isolation level 
skiplist nodes need to use times or some sort of counting method (could use tx id + clever )
skiplist nodes can store an array of the same keys with different verisons as a solution
to mvcc
properly pin pages, memtables etc
properly scan memtables


consider key-value seperation
mirgrate db to use fancier comparisions
cache line bloom filters
