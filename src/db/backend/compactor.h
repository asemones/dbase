//compaction algorithm:
/*
leveled compaction with the goal of cutting down on high latency spikes: We can assume that b bytes of io bandwith are assigned to the dbms
by the user. This assumption allows us to create a scheduler that dynamically allocates io bandwith. From this, we can
take advantage of io bandwith when it is avaliable, avoiding latency spikes from compaction triggers lining up. Instead, 
we can use this scheduler to preform single-file compactations when there is "free" bandwith.
We can split all io operations into three priority levels, each one managed by thread(s). The first level
is for any memtable flushes and WAL. The second level is for the "shallow" level compactations (l_0, l_1)
and the third level for deeper level compactions. To prevent l_0 being filled with a bunch of tiny ssts, second level
compactions will always occur even if memtable flush rate is high. In such events, the bandwith will be assigned in a way
to maximize overall throughput to moving ssts from memory to l_1.

General compactation process:
1. Check if bandwith is avaliable for compaction SKIP FOR BASE
2. If bandwith is avaliable, check if a compactation is beneficial. This can be set as a "miniumum compactation size"
   . This is different from the maxiumum size of a sst level. If too small, return. SKIP FOR BASE
3. Then check the size of the next level. If it has room, continue. If not, return and call compact on next level down  
4  If a compactation is needed, find the sst files to merge by targeting files with overlapping key-ranges. 
   . This can be done by checking the metadata of each sst file. 
5. Then preform the compactation in the following manner:
    a. Load the sst files into memory
    b. Merge the sst files
    c. Write sst to a new file
    d. Update the metadata and bloom filter
    e. Delete the old sst files
6. Repeat 1-5 until level is empty
*/
/*More in depth algorithm:
Every x seconds run a basic compactation check on the compact thread. 
If needed utilize a thread from the threadpool to complete the job
