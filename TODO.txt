implement the io-uring write engine
implement scheduling with coroutines
//complete both by march 14th, fully tested and intergrated
consider key-value seperation
iterator filters
cache line bloom filters
merge codebase with new scheduler features

requirements:
1. change cache to the new model
    since everything now needs to be alligned to 4kb pages even with compression, this presents 
    a challenge. find a fix
    fixed!
2. route all requests thru the io io_manager
3. change compactor to function with new system 
4. remove all old synchronization


the way the db may be interacted with: compactor operations, read/write. api calls
become tasks in the scheduler, and the compactor scheduler will just get ran with compactions then becoming
subtasks.
figure out how to return values from one shard
just submit tasks to shards, nothing fancy, task function should be the same
if doing distributed tx


figure out how the fuck to do cache with the force 4kb read size, zero copy, no long waits
either get rid of compression, or add a logical to physical compression map that gets filled on 
Solved without a linked list or a map or high compute- a little tacky though

figure out cascade api 
cases for tasks:
a task is submitted on a calling thread NOT apart of cascade. Here, the return value is left to the caller to Solved
a task is submitted on the same thread as the runtime. Here, we may do a special kind of yield that awaits the result of this task, or multiple task
via a fork join (SOLVED)
a task is submitted on a calling thread apart of a different runtime in cascade. Here, we may use an interruptable return to await the task, or multiple task
via a fork join. There are several ways to solve this one. here are the cases:

case WAIT: 
    sender calls a rpc and waits
    recv recieves and submits into framework
    recv task completes. flag is marked indicating its a wait case
    recv somehow sends a message to the sender shard with the return value
    sender resumes with new return value
case NOWAIT
    sender calls a rpc and immediately returns
    recv recieves and submits into framework
    recv task completes. flag is marked indicating NOWAIT
    recv sends message to sender shard indicating this
    sender shard then ???

db_schedule* schedule


we can do a queue with "active" indexs (or just the raw ptrs)
fix how ids are mapped to inbox indices
